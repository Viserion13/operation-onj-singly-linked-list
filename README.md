# Operations-On-Singly-Linked-Lists
## Aim:-
        Operations On Singly linked list.
### Theory:-
              A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links                 which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure                   after array.
#### Algorihm:-
              1)Start
              2)int main()
              3)insertnodefirst()
              4)insertnodelast()
              5)insertnodemiddle()
              6)deletenodefirst()
              7)deletenodelast()
              8)deletenodemiddle()
              9)Display()
              10)End
##### Conclusion:-
                  From this proram we learnt how to erform different types of insertion and deletion functions n singly linked list.
